# Bharat-Data-Science-Intern-tasks
This is part of the Bharat Data Science Internship tasks <br>
Task 2 : Titanic Survival rate prediction<br>
Task 3 : Handwritten digits classification using Keras neural network<br>
For the task 2 I've collected the data from kaggle competition, which had features like Age, Sex , Ticket Fare, Location Boarded and the target feature Survived which was binary(Survived/ Not Survived) <br>
After that I've cleaned the dataset, filling null values, then doing eda on the data to find the features related to the Survival rate<br>
Next , I've used Logistic Regression to predict the survival rate of the Passengers<br>
<br>
For the task 3 , I've used the tensorflow and keras api to do the task<br>
For this, Ive got the train and testing data from keras api itself, which has the image pixels , as the features and the labels as the target,<br>
Then I've used a sequential model with three layers<br>
After that I trained the model for 5 epochs giving an accuracy of 98<br>
At last predicting the test dataset and plotting in the confusion matrix<br>
