This is part of the Bharat Data Science Internship tasks <br>
Task 2 : Titanic Survival rate prediction<br>
Task 3 : Handwritten digits classification using Keras neural network<br>
For the task 2 I've collected the data from kaggle competition, which had features like Age, Sex , Ticket Fare, Location Boarded and the target feature Survived which was binary(Survived/ Not Survived)
